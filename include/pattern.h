 * Notes:
 *   The details of implementation depend on the lattice type.
 *    In the case of an orthogonal lattice, we use a rectangular quad mesh.
 *   We use an interpolation scheme on the dual mesh to compute the
 *   constraints, which is piecewise constant over each edge. The Laplacian
 *   is then just a generalized (4,-1,-1,-1,-1) stencil.
 *    In the case of a non-orthogonal lattice, we split the parallelogramic
 *   discretization cells along the short diagonal into two triangles. We
 *   assume that the triangulation is well centered and use a circumcentric
 *   dual mesh with a diagonal Hodge star to construct the Laplacian. The
 *   constraints are enforced using the primal Whitney 1-form interpolator.
 *    In both cases, the resulting field is computed by the proper
 *   interpolation scheme at the centers of the parallelogramic discretization
 *   cells. The constraints are enforced using weighted least squares with
 *   uniform weights per edge (not per edge-shape intersection).
 *    To deal with shapes extending beyond the origin-centered fundamental
 *   parallelogram of the lattice, edge-shape intersections are computed using
 *   each shape and its 8 nearest neighbor unit cell copies.
